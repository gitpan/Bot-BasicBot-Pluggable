Revision history for Perl extension Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable.

0.81 2009/08/30
 
  - redfined logic of --store option

    Although i added a store option in the last version of the
    command line bot, it wasn't really helpful as you just could
    load storage backend without any options. The --store option
    is now a hashref, with the onyl drawback that you have to
    specify a storage type even if you just want load a backend
    without any options.

  - moved store_from_hashref from B::BB::P to B::BB::P::Store and
    renamed it to new_from_hashref. This could possibly *break*
    code, but i didn't expect it to.

0.80 2009/08/15

  - new command line bot
    
    big rewrite of the command line bot with the help of MooseX::Getopt
    and MooseX::SimpleConfig. It should be possible to call a lot of
    aspects of the pluggable infrastructure without writing perl code.

0.79 2009/07/12
  - the need-more-sleep-release ... sorry, that's the last for today
  - replied was never called ... now we put it back in front again
    but shallow copy the message first

0.78 2009/07/12
  - replied is now called after reply so that modules really can't change the message

0.77 2009/07/12
  - added a new event 'replied' to give any module the chance to act on that
  - Join:
    - corrected missing command in help
  - Seen:
    - now also reckognize joins and parts
  - Infobot:
    - there's an user defineable http_timeout variabe that defaults to ten 
      seconds (fixes #3239) 
    - settable limit on how many RSS items to return 
    - just shorten entries when @entries is bigger than user_max_entries 
  - Vars:
    - checking the definedness of $value so you can set a variable to 0 for example

0.76 2009/06/28
  - the store paramter to B:BB:P->new() can now also be a string
  - new config interface for modules
  - search for keywords in Infobot.pm now returns the right number of factoids
  - when deleting factoids return the right answer
  - total rewrite of the join module (old database format will be converted on the fly)
  - a lot of new tests
  - new module Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Store::Memory (kind of)
  - new module Test::Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Store
  - testbot now intercepts the help call

0.74 2009/06/20

  - added additional slash to fix #46928 (t/05infobot.t)
  - added t/03store_storable.t
  - closes #3258: instead of just overwriting the storable file it creates a tempfile and the move it
  - Moved FakeBot to Test::Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable so that it's accessable for other Modules
  - renamed infobot.t and title.t
  - only create a new table if it doesn't exists yet in Store::DBI

0.72 2009/06/04

  - Fixed absolute path in t/infobot.t ... stupid!
  - Added me (Mario) to the author list 
  - Added the git repository to the meta resources

0.71 2009/06/01

  - Add a test for unparsable rss feeds to Infobot
  - Better error message for unparsable rss feeds in Infobot
  - Added ignore_re option to Title (by osfameron)
  - Adjusting documentation for Load to refer to the real behaviour
 
0.7 2009/03/10
  - Missing t/FakeBot.pm added to MANIFEST
  - Adjusted number of tests for Test::More
  - Karma:
    - Testsuide added
    - Listing of explainations works again (settable by num_comments)
    - New variable random_reasons
    - Documentation updated

0.6 2009/03/04

It's been.. uh.. 4 years. There are tickets in RT that simply don't apply to
the current codebase. Personally, I never work on this module, use it for one
small thing that never changes, and have started to really dislike programming
in perl recently. Thus I'm just going to release trunk as-is. It's got a lot
of changes. Things might break. Sorry. I dislike other people doing this,
and I dislike _me_ doing this, but I see very few other options at this point.
 
I'm putting all the code in a github repository at

http://github.com/jerakeen/bot-basicbot-pluggable

if people want to actually track what goes on. Anyone want to take B::B::P
over?

--

This is the "Morbus release". Why the "Morbus release"?
Quite simply because he did everything you see below.
You can chastise him for his ego at http://disobey.com/.

  - Revised documentation for Pluggable.pm and Module.pm.
  - Auth: Revised documentation, switched to admin() not said().
  - DNS: Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
  - Google:
    - Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
    - Removed deprecated Net::Google ie() and oe() methods.
    - Default language restriction set to just 'en'; removed 'fr'.
    - Removed explicit starts_at of 0, which is the default.
    - New option added: num_results (default: 3).
    - New option added: languages (default: en).
    - New option added: require_addressing (default: 1).
  - Join: Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
  - Karma:
    - Revised documentation, switched to told() and seen().
    - Replaced fisher_yates with newer version from Perl 5.8.
    - Fixed a bunch of little nigglies here and there.
    - New option added: num_comments (default: 3).
    - New option added: show_givers (default: 1).
    - New option added: ignore_selfkarma (default: 1).
    - If only "karma", we assume $mess->{who} now.
    - Now understands "<botname>++" and "<botname>--";
  - Loader: Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
  - Seen:
    - Revised documentation, switched to seen() and told().
    - Echoed $who is now what the user typed, not lc'd version.
    - New option added: allow_hiding (default: 1).
  - Title: Revised documentation, switched to admin() not said().
  - Vars:
    - Revised documentation, switched to told() not said().
    - Removed the check for the existence of $value on a !set. This
      check would fail whenever anyone tried to set the $value to 0,
      which makes perfect sense when you're trying to turn off a boolean'd
      feature. !unset doesn't work because that entirely deletes the 
      $variable, which means it'll be reset to the default the next
      time the module is reloaded or the bot is restarted.
  - Revised documentation for Store.pm and Store/* modules.
  - Infobot:
    - Revised all the documentation, added more examples.
    - Removed the 'ask' option; it was never actually used.
    - Renamed option 'passive_ask' to 'passive_answer'. More sense.
    - Added a small but decent list of common stopwords.
    - New option: num_results (for "search for <term>"; default 20).
    - New option: require_question ("water?" or "water"; default 1).
    - Entirely removed the "literal $object" feature.
    - New option: min_length (minimum $object length; default 3).
    - New option: max_length (maximum $object length; default 25).
    - New option: unknown_responses (random list of "No clue." responses).
    - You can now replace facts with "no, $bot, $object is..." too.
    - $who in a factoid is now replaced by $mess->{who}.
    - Stopwords were NOT being stopped on word boundaries. Fixed.
    - "no, $bot, $object is also $fact" now works for appending.
    - Added handling of "my" as in "my cat is named chloe".

0.50 2004/01/18
  - Moved Bot::BasicBot::Pluggble::Module::Base to B::B::P::Module.pm,
    and added Base.pm as an empty subclass, for neatness.
  - Documented the object store methods better.
  - Changed all core modules to use the proget get/set store methods.
  - Loader now uses the standard store system.
  - Installed shell script to run B::B::P.
  - The Infobot module can now passively learn and passively answer questions
    (without direct addressing) and you can set these options seperately.
  - The storage system is decently abstracted out, and has a
    default that does the same thing as the last one.
  - Gave the bot a default charset of utf8, because I'm a fan of utf8.
  - Utterly changed the Infobot back-end store system. Updating it will be
    a pain, I'm sorry, but the last one really sucked. Re-wrote the Infobot
    module to be _readable_, or at least slightly less nasty than before.
    
0.30
  - Improved docs.
  - Synced version number with Bot::BasicBot again.
  - Added NINJA support.
  - Moved to Module::Build-based module layout.
  - Huge docs improvement, based on feedback from people who
    clearly had no idea what I was smoking at the time.
  - Decent examples in examples/, and web page copies for people who use CPAN.
  - Removed Blog and Shout modules - Blog to be spun off
    into a seperate module, Shout was just stupid.
  - Support for loading modules from 'Modules' in cwd as well as main lib path.
  - The bot is a lot less case-sensitive. Still sensitive for loading
    modules, but all the help, etc commands are more friendly.
  - Removed 'reply' method (now in Bot::BasicBot).
  - Slight module API changes, nothing significant:
    - Added a 'tick' callback that happens every 5 seconds.
    - Added a 'reply' local method that mirrors the Bot::BasicBot reply.
    - Added a 'say' method that calls the Bot::BasicBot say.
    - Added a very simple 'tell' method for simple statements.
    - Added an 'emoted' callback that works identically to 'said'.
    - Added a 'chanjoin' callback, called when someone joins a channel.
    - Added a 'chanpart' callback, called when someone leaves a channel.
  - Module changes (other than doc improvements):
    - Auth:
      - Fixed silly bug that meant you didn't actually need to auth.
      - Smarter about ignoring things that aren't admin commands.
      - Now requires direct addressing.
    - Blog: removed. Look for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Blog.
    - Spell: Fixed a spelling mistake.
    - Infobot: Fixed annoying parser bugs. Needs to re-write whole thing soon.
    - Karma: Removed case-sensitivity in karma objects.
